Stone paper scissor is  very popular game .This game which I made using Javascript html and  Css


**Rock paper scissors** (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" 
sometimes being called "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo)[1][2][3] is a 
hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms 
one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" 
(a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 
"Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except 
that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
